The motive behind developers creating these algorithms is because they can sell them to other stakeholders on our website in order to gain a profit. A developer would also have a profile that represents how knowledgeable they are: Education, CV, etc. The profile can also have comments of past/present customers that can comment on the quality of code/predictions that the developer created. <br/> The developer would have a good background on machine learning methods such as linear regression, dimensions reduction methods, KNN, etc. They then would use their knowledge to attempt to predict patterns in the stock. </p>

They would search the market on our website for specific algorithm and determine a cost-benefit analysis for the potential purchase of that algorithm. They would also have access to our interactive UI to help create their domain specific algorithms as well as a dashboard to view their findings. <br/>They would have knowledge of the stock market and a understanding of the formulas behind these algorithms. </p>

They could search the market on our website for a specific algorithm and would be able to purchase the algorithms. A researcher would also have access to the developer dashboards to create and/or manipulate formulas and algorithms. Researchers would also be able to sell their finding on the market for a profit. <br/>A researcher would have a understanding of the statistics and mathematics behind machine learning. Additionally a researcher(if working) could be funded by a university institution or private institution to make these purchases.</p>
