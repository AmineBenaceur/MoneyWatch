The motive behind developers creating these algorithms is because they can sell them to other stakeholders on our website in order to gain a profit. A developer would also have a profile that represents how knowledgeable they are: Education, CV, etc. The profile can also have comments of past/present customers that can comment on the quality of code/predictions that the developer created.
The developer would have a good background on machine learning methods such as linear regression, dimensions reduction methods, KNN, etc. They then would use their knowledge to attempt to predict patterns in the stock.

They would have knowledge of the stock market and a understanding of the formulas behind these algorithms.

                <p>Money Watch assists users doing market research by making programming more accessible. The individual will be able to create a process that are as simple as linear regress or as complicated as bleeding edge Artificial Intelligence machine learning algorithm with similar effort. We will accomplish this by making modules that are repeatable with and shareable among colleagues as well as communities. These modules could receive some, do some operation, and finally output some new information. These would then be chained together to create a money making machine!</p>
                <p>As with any machine we want to be able to open it up and see what’s going on. This is where the graphics module comes in. This module will require some input which is used to create some graphics. These graphics could be bar graphs, line graphs or just some random image that will help the user understand his system, and or data.
                Money Watch encourages creativity in order to make discoveries!</p>
